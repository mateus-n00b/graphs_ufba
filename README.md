# Description

These scripts are our final homework from discipline of Graphs and Algorithms.

We have used a pruning heuristic to remove edges and vertices from a dynamic graph.

We aim to reduce the complexity of the algorithm and create a Stable Distribution Tree by using


the Link Lifetime as edges weight.
